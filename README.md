## What can you do in Inuhh Shinvasion?

Inuhh Shinvasion is a game containing many secrets and missions. If you complete one mission and open the "Achievements" menu on the starting screen, you'll see a golden embleme before the criterion you managed to beat, for example beating all levels in the game. Try to get all achievements to make everyone jealous!

## What are Shi Coins?

In Inuhh Shinvasion several special coins, called Shi Coins, can be found at hidden places. At a certain place it is possible to trade them for helpful things, which may help out in the later game (the game is still possible to beat without them, albeit at a much higher difficulty), so try to find as many as possible of them. In each level segment at least one Shi Coin can be found. Maybe you can even find some other rare objects!
