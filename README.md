# Inuhh-Shinvasion
This game is a jump'n'run about a dog. No plumber, no penguin, no hedgehog. A dog.

## Story

The protagonist is Inuhh, a dog, whose world got invaded by a weird alien race, called "Shi". His goal is, of course, to defeat the Shi empire. This would be easy if the Shi weren't masters of genetics and produced a huge number of variations of themselves. Some have spikes, others are much faster than normal ones, and some are even gigantic. If Inuhh travels through the five worlds of Westton, he may have a chance to expel the Shi from there.

## Instructions and informations

Current version of the game: 1.0.0 (June 14th 2017)

The game is written in Ruby and programmed using the Gosu library. Use [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) on Windows and make sure to use Ruby Version 2.0 or preferably newer. Also follow the instructions on [the Gosu website](https://www.libgosu.org/ruby.html) to install the Gosu library.

The game itself can be started by using "ruby Inuhh.rb" in a terminal or by executing "Inuhh Shinvasion.rbw" on Windows.

Don't expect any music besides some jingles. This game has none. And this is because ~~this game is an experimental avantgarde game which will leave your imagination with the task of creating background music~~ I have no talent and was too lazy to search for free music.

Also despite this game being fully playable, I may add some features in the future, if I have the time and motivation to do so. Also I will of course try to fix any bugs as soon as possible.

## What can you do in Inuhh Shinvasion?

Inuhh Shinvasion is a game containing many secrets and missions. If you complete one mission and open the "Achievements" menu on the starting screen, you'll see a golden embleme before the criterion you managed to beat, for example beating all levels in the game. Try to get all achievements to make everyone jealous!

## What are Shi Coins?

In Inuhh Shinvasion several special coins, called Shi Coins, can be found at hidden places. At a certain place it is possible to trade them for helpful things, which may help out in the later game (the game is still possible to beat without them, albeit at a much higher difficulty), so try to find as many as possible of them. In each level segment at least one Shi Coin can be found. Maybe you can even find some other rare objects!
