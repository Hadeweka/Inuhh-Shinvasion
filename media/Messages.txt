#Message 0000:
Welcome to the world of Inuhh!
This is a test!
#===#
I hope, this test is working...
So, let's see.
#EndMessage

#Message 0001:
Welcome to the world of Inuhh Shinvasion!
These signposts can provide you helpful
information, so just watch out for them.
#===#
First a few things:
Beware of those enemies over there.
They seem harmless, but only until
you run into one of them.
And don't ever think you could
predict all enemies... they may behave
very random, so be careful!
#===#
Some enemies even try to kill you
from below. If you're gaining
height or just standig around, they'll
crash into you and damage you.
If you're falling down,
they're the ones taking damage, though.
#===#
More interesting for you are the coins
scattered in all of the levels.
Collect 100 of them and you'll
obtain an additional life.
#===#
If you lose a life, you have to restart
the section in which you died.
When no more lifes are left, you even
have to restart the entire level, so
always keep an eye on your lifes!
#===#
Luckily you are quite robust, so you
don't suddenly lose a life if you kiss
an ordinary enemy, you just lose some
energy. If your energy is at zero,
however, you will lose a life.
#===#
You can see your lifes and energy in
the bottom left corner, as well as your
coins and your score.
In the bottom right corner you can see
your stats, like strength and defense.
#EndMessage

#Message 0002:
As you may see, your jumps aren't far
enough to cross some holes. Running and
then jumping may help.
#EndMessage

#Message 0003:
These gems can give you an extra life,
so keep your eyes open. Just collect 15
or more of them and you can pay them
while on the world map.
If you have more gems with you, the
lifes even get cheaper.
#===#
Maybe you'll even find some other
valuable things?
#EndMessage

#Message 0004:
Congratulations!
You found a rare Shi Coin!
Each Shi Coin can be collected multiple
times, but it will only be counted as one.
#===#
Despite their rareness, only a few persons
need them, so just wait for someone asking
for them.
#EndMessage

#Message 0005:
Beware of these gaps!
If you fall into one of them, you will
die instantly! Even if you are careful,
an enemy could push you into one.
#===#
Also take care of gaps in deep water,
since they'll kill you as well.
#EndMessage

#Message 0006:
Wondering what this is?
It's a bone, a dog should know that,
of course. Collect it to heal one point
of energy. Not the best thing, but hey,
it tastes nice (at least for dogs).
#EndMessage

#Message 0007:
As you see, there isn't only one type
of enemies. Observe them a little
bit to find out their behaviour and
maybe some weak spots.
#===#
Also, take care of your energy. Some
enemies are stronger than others!
#EndMessage

#Message 0008:
Welcome to the surfing and diving
zone! Use high cliffs and deep caves
at own risk!
#===#
...
Here are absolutely NO secrets, okay?
Don't try to find some in this
uninteresting lake! NOTHIN' HERE!
#EndMessage

#Message 0009:
You can swim in water, but even in
there you'll find some enemies.
Remember that gravity still works
under water, since the physics
engine in this game acts weird.
#EndMessage

#Message 0010:
You just found a warp.
Use them to get to other sections of
this level!
#EndMessage

#Message 0011:
Congratulations, if you enter
this white warp, you beat this level!
Then another level on the worldmap
will be unlocked.
#===#
If you manage to find a light blue
warp, consider yourself lucky!
Light blue warps lead to secret places
with many secrets... wow!
#===#
Remember that you can play each
beaten level again, so don't worry
too much if you've left something
out or didn't find everything.
#EndMessage

#Message 0012:
Warps don't always lead to another
section. Sometimes they can port you
to another point in the same section.
Pay attention to their delay, because
they need a little time to recharge,
but then teleport you mercilessly
again, if you are too slow.
#EndMessage

#Message 0013:
Some gaps are very thin, so that
you sometimes don't get in at the
first try. Just try again some times,
exercising isn't that bad for your
figure, so maybe it fits then.
#EndMessage

#Message 0014:
House of the Hedgehound
#===#
Got some Shi Coins?
Don't know what to do with 'em?
Bring them to me, got something
interesting for you, I think.
#===#
Also, take a look at some other
funny things in my house!
#EndMessage

#Message 0015:
Object #2819: Wings
Collect them to fly around in the
section you are at the moment, like
being in water.
#EndMessage

#Message 0016:
Object #0001: Hedgehound
Rare subject who sells interesting
things for Shi Coins.
#===#
Choose one of his offers by pressing
the number left to it on the keyboard.
Choose wisely, you cannot undo it!
To exit the shop, press Return.
#EndMessage

#Message 0017:
The weird thing right to you is, as
you can see, not very nice to you.
The Shi designed it to spawn a
certain amount of enemies...
maybe even an infinite amount?
#EndMessage

#Message 0018:
You made it through the world of the
Cleanbuil Lake! Now you're ready to
enter the mysterious Dominwood...
#===#
Just use the warp right over there
and soon you are there!
To go back to this world, you just
have to go west on the world map.
#EndMessage

#Message 0019:

If you find this, please don't steal
something out of here.
I don't like such things like theft.
#===#
- Note from Admiral Fowenyuhh:
Too late, brave finder!
Silverfish is imprisoned and the
treasure now belongs to the
holy king of Twoahteh.
#===#
Only this weird pedestal boxes
remain here. If you have enough
space, you could build up a
pedestal to reach higher places.
Space is the key to success!
- Note end.
#EndMessage

#Message 0020:
Some idiots told me something like
'Beware of the armed Shi!' or so.
But Shi don't have arms!
#EndMessage

#Message 0021:
You are now at a very unknown place
of the Cleanbuil Lake.
Only very few know about what
lies behind the next warp, so
be VERY careful!
#===#
...however I don't know, why this
signpost is here. I guess it's
just here for gameplay reasons.
#EndMessage

#Message 0022:
Have you found some secret areas yet?
If not, just visit the Cleanbuil Lake
again, maybe you find some helpful
things... or even allies...
#EndMessage

#Message 0023:
You're now entering the great
Dominwood Forest.
Here you can find some delicious
fruit which can heal you if you
eat five of them.
#===#
The enemies in this forest are stronger
than in the lake region, though.
Some of them try to disguise themselves,
some other only want to confuse you.
#EndMessage

#Message 0024:
Property of the Shi Empire.

Welcome to the Westton Mountain!
This world won't be as easy as the last
two worlds, so better look twice if unsure.
#===#
The Shi in this world are stronger than
in the Dominwood, so here might be some
well guarded hidden place...
Camouflage isn't that important for the Shi
anymore, they are now more aggressive and
will brutally try to eliminate anyone crossing
their sections.
#EndMessage

#Message 0031:
I don't like breaking the fourth wall, but:
There are some rare objects in this
game you should use! Some of them,
like bones, are used instantly.
Other objects you can carry only
one at a time, this will be displayed
then with an appropriate icon.
#===#
Commonly there are signposts next to
those objects, so read them carefully
before using the objects.
You can also press F1 to obtain some
details about those objects and other
useful things.
#===#
Some special objects can be collected
multiple times, so you can use them
more than one time. You'll lose them
all if you're collecting an object
of another kind, though, so pay attention!

Hooray, you beat the Westton Mountain!
But there are some obscure caves below.
#===#
Some enemies here seem familiar,
but beware of their enormous strength!
There must be some interesting thing if
it is guarded that heavily...
#===#
Maybe you'll find something that can
be used to inflict some serious
damage to the Shi... or something
entirely different?
#EndMessage

#Message 0041:
By pressing Space you can easily reach
higher positions by placing this pedestal
below yourself. Never use it if you don't

#EndMessage

#Message 0044:
You crushed through the Westton Base!
But the last obstacle still waits
for you...
#===#
This area is the Shi District of
the Westton Mountain. The Shi
working here will do anything to
destroy you... really anything!
#===#
Somewhere in this area has to be
their mothership, though. If you
manage to find it you could finally
stop their invasion! But first you
must find a way to get to it.
I can't help you with that.
#===#
Also, if you haven't found an
opportunity to strengthen
yourself, you should do that
as soon as possible. The Shi got
an army which can conquer the
entire world in no time!
#EndMessage

#Message 0045:
You have only your feet to destroy
your enemies. Maybe you'll need to
find something more useful.
#EndMessage

#Message 0046:
This is the centre of the
Shi Sanatorium.
#===#
Here you will lose the last bits
of your mind while slowly drowning
in insanity.
#===#
Escape quickly and you'll be save.
Stay here and look for something
valuable... and the chances are
high you will have to stay here
forever.
#===#
If you really want to destroy
yourself... not my problem.
I'm just a message board.
I am already insane. Huehuehue...

Welcome to Horror Island!

You think, the Shi Factory and the Shi

#===#
Well, you still beat those levels. So they
shouldn't be THAT hard, right?
Wrong.
This world may be the hardest
world in this game.
#===#
If you are easy frustrated, better give
up before it's too late. It is not
worth the pain... or is it?
